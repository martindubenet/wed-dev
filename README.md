# Web-dev wiki

You won't find any code lines in this project.

I use this repository to store all my knowlage under the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki). From there use the **Search** from the sidebar navigation to find content.

### Most useful documents

From all my wiki pages, here's a list of my most used ones:

* [Characters cheatsheet](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki/Characters-cheatsheet-–-HTML-vs-HEX-vs-Glyphicons-–-En-Fr-lexicon) is a lexicon of HTML characters, including some latin characters commonly used in French. Each characters is described in both English and French and some have a link to their _FontAwesome_ equivalence.
* My plain list of [Bootstrap (4.4) utility classes for Atomic CSS](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki/code-•-Bootstrap) allows me to quickly find the classes I need.

... So far, as of january 2020, I have 39 pages in my wiki and I keep adding as I learn new stuff.
